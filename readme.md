# 🌌 NEURAL GRIMOIRE: COSMIC LORA 🕸️

## Behold, Mortal: A Glimpse into Computational Madness

### 𝒯𝒽𝑒 ℰ𝓁𝒹𝓇𝒾𝓉𝒸𝒽 ℱ𝓇𝒶𝓂𝑒𝓌𝑜𝓇𝓀

Witness the cosmic horror of machine learning adaptation, where neural networks twist and mutate beyond human comprehension. This React artifact is no mere component—it is a portal into the interdimensional realm of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

#### 🌑 Summoning the Artifact

##### Arcane Dependencies
Prepare these eldritch incantations in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "framer-motion": "^10.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

##### Ritual of Deployment: GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to bind this cosmic entity to the mortal realm:

```yaml
name: NEURAL GRIMOIRE DEPLOYMENT

  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read

          publish_dir: ./build
```

#### 🕷️ Interdimensional Configuration

In `vite.config.js` (or your preferred build tool):

```javascript
export default {
  base: '/NEURAL_GRIMOIRE/', // Adjust to your cosmic realm's path
  plugins: [
    // Your reality-warping configurations
  ]
}
```

#### 📡 Deployment Incantations

```bash
# Prepare the ritual space
npm install

# Compile the neural matrix
npm run build

# Launch into the void
npm run deploy
```

### 🌠 Cosmic Warnings

- This artifact may cause temporary loss of perceived reality
- Side effects include: existential dread, computational enlightenment
- Do not stare directly into the neural matrices
