# Splunk Integrations with Enterprise ML Platform on k3s: A Comprehensive Guide

_A complete handbook for deploying and integrating Splunk Enterprise to monitor your ML lifecycle environment._

> **Note:** This guide assumes you have an operational k3s cluster with pre-loaded container images (airgap compliant) and that your environment already includes MLflow, MindsDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, and MinIO deployments. We now add Splunk Enterprise for centralized logging and monitoring.

## Introduction

Splunk Enterprise is a powerful tool for aggregating logs, monitoring system performance, and analyzing operational data. Integrating Splunk into your ML platform (which already includes MLflow, MindsDB, and Redis) helps you gain deep insights into application performance and security while maintaining compliance with airgap policies.

---

## System Overview

In this integrated solution, Splunk Enterprise acts as the centralized logging engine that collects data from:

- **MLflow:** Logs and experiment metadata.
- **MindsDB:** Automated training/prediction logs.
- **Redis:** Caching performance and operational logs.
- **Other Supporting Services:** PostgreSQL and MinIO.

Splunk aggregates these logs to provide real-time dashboards, alerting, and historical analysis—all within your secure, enterprise-grade environment.

---

## Prerequisites

- A running k3s cluster.
- Pre-loaded container images (for airgap compliance), including Splunk Enterprise and optionally the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- Basic Kubernetes and Splunk operational knowledge.
- Network connectivity between your ML components and Splunk services (configured via Kubernetes NetworkPolicies if needed).

## Deploying Splunk Enterprise

### 4.1 Create a Secret for Splunk Credentials

Create a Kubernetes secret to securely store Splunk’s admin password.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: splunk-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>  # Encode your password using: echo -n "YourPassword" | base64

4.2 Deploy Splunk Enterprise

Deploy Splunk Enterprise using a Kubernetes Deployment. Adjust resource requests and persistent storage as required for your production environment.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: splunk-enterprise
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: splunk-enterprise
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: splunk-enterprise
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: splunk
        image: splunk/splunk:latest  # Ensure this image is pre-loaded in airgap mode
        env:
        - name: SPLUNK_START_ARGS
          value: "--accept-license"
        - name: SPLUNK_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: splunk-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000  # Default Splunk Web port
        volumeMounts:
        - name: splunk-data
          mountPath: /opt/splunk/var
      volumes:
      - name: splunk-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: splunk-pvc  # Ensure a PVC named splunk-pvc is created

4.3 Expose Splunk Enterprise with a Service

Expose Splunk Web interface using a Kubernetes Service (NodePort is used for demo purposes; consider Ingress/LoadBalancer for production).

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: splunk-enterprise
spec:
  selector:
    app: splunk-enterprise
  ports:
  - port: 8000
    targetPort: 8000
    nodePort: 30003  # Change as per your requirements
  type: NodePort

Apply the Splunk manifests:

kubectl apply -f splunk-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f splunk-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f splunk-service.yaml

Deploying Splunk Universal Forwarder

For robust log collection across your cluster, deploy the Splunk Universal Forwarder as a DaemonSet. This forwarder gathers logs from all nodes and forwards them to Splunk Enterprise.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: splunk-forwarder
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: splunk-forwarder
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: splunk-forwarder
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: splunk-forwarder
        image: splunk/universalforwarder:latest  # Use your airgap pre-loaded image
        env:
        - name: SPLUNK_FORWARD_SERVER
          value: "splunk-enterprise:8000"  # Point to the Splunk Enterprise service
        volumeMounts:
        - name: varlog
          mountPath: /var/log
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log

Apply the DaemonSet manifest:

kubectl apply -f splunk-forwarder-daemonset.yaml

Integrating Log Forwarding from ML Components

Configuring Log Output

Ensure that all ML components (MLflow, MindsDB, Redis, etc.) log to standard output (stdout/stderr). This allows the Splunk Universal Forwarder to capture container logs seamlessly.

Example: MLflow Logging Configuration

In your MLflow deployment, ensure the logging format is compatible (e.g., JSON or plain text). A typical configuration might look like:

# In mlflow-deployment.yaml under container spec:
env:
- name: LOG_FORMAT
  value: "json"

Sidecar Approach (Optional)

For more control, consider deploying a sidecar container in each pod that tails application logs and forwards them to Splunk using the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

Creating Dashboards and Alerts

Once logs are ingested by Splunk, use the Splunk Web UI to:
	•	Create Dashboards: Visualize key metrics from MLflow experiments, MindsDB predictions, and Redis performance.
	•	Set Up Alerts: Configure alerts for error patterns, latency spikes, or security events.
	•	Search and Analyze: Utilize Splunk’s powerful search language to correlate events across services.

Security and Best Practices
	•	Airgap Compliance: Ensure all Splunk images are pre-loaded and that the environment has no external dependencies during runtime.
	•	Persistent Storage: Use PersistentVolumes for Splunk Enterprise to safeguard indexed data.
	•	Network Policies: Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict access between Splunk services and other pods.
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Configure Splunk roles and permissions to secure sensitive log data.
	•	Encryption: Secure log data in transit using TLS (configure Splunk HEC endpoints accordingly).

Final Thoughts & Production Tips
	•	Scalability: Depending on log volume, consider scaling Splunk Enterprise and forwarder deployments.
	•	Monitoring: Regularly review Splunk dashboards to preemptively address issues in your ML environment.
	•	Customization: Adapt the Splunk configurations to meet specific compliance and performance requirements of your enterprise.
	•	Documentation: Keep detailed records of all configurations and any custom integrations for future audits.

This guide equips you with the necessary steps to integrate Splunk Enterprise into your enterprise ML platform on k3s. Enjoy leveraging Splunk’s powerful analytics to maintain full observability and control over your ML lifecycle!

Feel free to modify and extend this guide based on your production environment’s needs.
