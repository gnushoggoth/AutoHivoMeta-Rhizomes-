**Version:** [e.g., 1.0.0]
**Date:** [Date of this Plan]

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the steps to deploy a Solana program built using the Anchor framework to [Target Environment: Devnet, Testnet, or Mainnet-Beta].  It covers pre-deployment checks, deployment procedures, post-deployment verification, and rollback strategies.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   **Solana CLI Tools Installed:** Ensure you have the latest version of the Solana CLI tools installed and configured. Verify with `solana --version`.
*   **Anchor CLI Installed:**  Ensure you have the Anchor CLI installed. Verify with `anchor --version`.
*   **Wallet Setup:**
    *   **Deployment Wallet:** A Solana wallet (keypair) with sufficient SOL to cover deployment costs and rent exemption for your program.  This wallet should be configured as the default wallet for the Solana CLI (`solana config set --keypair <path/to/keypair.json>`).
    *   **Authority Wallet (Optional):** If your program uses upgradeable features, ensure the authority wallet is secured and available.
*   **Rust Environment:** A working Rust development environment with the correct Solana target installed (`rustup target add solana`).
*   **Source Code:** The complete and tested source code of your Anchor program.
*   **Anchor.toml Configuration:** A properly configured `Anchor.toml` file, including:
    *   `[programs.<environment>]` sections for your target environment (devnet, testnet, mainnet-beta).  Make sure the `cluster` setting is correct.
    *   `[provider]` section with the correct `wallet` path.
    *   `[scripts]` section (optional, but good practice) for custom build/test/deploy commands.
* **Program ID**: Ensure you have your declared program ID. This can be found by running `anchor keys list` in your terminal.
* **Build Artifacts**: The compiled program, typically a shared object file (`.so`) located in the `target/deploy/` directory after running `anchor build`.
## 3. Pre-Deployment Checklist

*   [ ] **Code Review:**  A thorough code review has been conducted, addressing security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and adherence to best practices.
*   [ ] **Audits (Optional but HIGHLY Recommended):** For mainnet-beta deployments, consider a professional security audit.  Document any findings and remediations.
*   [ ] **Testing:**
    *   [ ] **Unit Tests:** All unit tests within the Anchor program pass (`anchor test`).
    *   [ ] **Integration Tests (Optional):**  Integration tests (written in TypeScript or Rust) that interact with a local validator or devnet pass.
    *   [ ] **Testnet Deployment (Recommended):**  Deploy to testnet first to mimic mainnet conditions as closely as possible.  Perform end-to-end testing.
*   [ ] **Resource Estimation:**
    *   [ ] **Compute Budget:** Estimate the compute units required for typical program instructions.  Consider using the `solana cost-model` CLI tool.
    *   [ ] **Storage (Rent):** Calculate the required rent-exempt balance for your program's accounts.  Anchor's `#[account]` attribute helps with this. Use `solana rent <size_in_bytes>` to estimate.
    *   [ ] **Transaction Fees:** Estimate the transaction fees for typical interactions.
*   [ ] **Documentation:**
    *   [ ] **Program Interface (IDL):** Ensure the Anchor IDL (`target/idl/[program_name].json`) is up-to-date. This is used for client-side interactions.
    *   [ ] **README:**  Update the project README with deployment instructions, program ID, and usage examples.
    *   [ ] **API Documentation (Optional):** Generate API documentation (e.g., using `cargo doc`) for public-facing functions.
*   [ ] **Environment Variables:**  Ensure any required environment variables are set correctly for the target environment.
*   [ ] **Backup:**  Back up your program's keypair and any important configuration files.
*   [ ] **Team Communication:**  Inform relevant team members about the planned deployment.

## 4. Deployment Steps

1.  **Build the Program:**
    ```bash
    anchor build
    ```
    *   This command compiles the Rust code into a Solana executable (`.so` file) and generates the IDL file.

2.  **Verify Program ID:**
    ```bash
    anchor keys list
    ```
    * This will output the program ID, verify it matches your declared program ID.

3.  **Deploy to the Target Environment:**
    ```bash
    anchor deploy
    ```
    *   This command deploys the compiled program (`.so` file) to the specified cluster (devnet, testnet, or mainnet-beta) defined in `Anchor.toml`.  It uses the wallet configured in `Anchor.toml` (and the Solana CLI).
    *   **Important:** Pay close attention to the output.  It will display the program ID, transaction signature, and any errors.  Record this information.
    * **If deploying to Mainnet:** You can add the `--mainnet` flag: `anchor deploy --mainnet`.

4. **Verify Deployment**

* Check the program ID deployed matches your local Program ID
* Confirm by using solana explorer: [https://explorer.solana.com/](https://explorer.solana.com/)

## 5. Post-Deployment Verification

1.  **Check Program ID:**
    ```bash
    solana program show <YOUR_PROGRAM_ID>
    ```
    *   Verify that the program is deployed at the expected program ID and that the authority matches your expectations.

2.  **Basic Interaction Test:**
    *   Use the Anchor-generated TypeScript client (or `solana-web3.js`) to perform a basic interaction with your deployed program (e.g., call an initialization instruction).  This confirms that the program is responding correctly.

3.  **Monitor Logs:**
    ```bash
    solana logs <YOUR_PROGRAM_ID>
    ```
    *   Monitor the program's logs for any errors or unexpected behavior.

4.  **Run Integration Tests (Optional):**  Re-run your integration tests against the deployed program to ensure full functionality.

## 6. Rollback Plan

If the deployment fails or the program behaves unexpectedly, have a rollback plan in place:

*   **Option 1: Redeploy a Previous Version (if upgradeable):**
    *   If your program is upgradeable, you can redeploy a previously working version using `anchor deploy` with the older `.so` file.  You'll need to use the authority keypair.

*   **Option 2:  Set a New Buffer Authority (if not upgradeable):**
     *   If the program is *not* upgradeable, there's no direct way to "undeploy" it. You can attempt to:
       *    Zero out program data (if your program logic allows it), effectively disabling it, but it will still exist on-chain.
       *    Create a new version with a different program ID and migrate users to the new version.  This is the most common approach for non-upgradeable programs.
       *    If applicable, set the Buffer Authority to a new key.

*   **Option 3:  Zero-out Program Data (if possible):**
    *   If your program's design allows, you could create an instruction that zeros out all the data in the program's accounts, effectively rendering it inert. This doesn't remove the program, but it stops it from functioning.

*   **Option 4:  Do Nothing (last resort):**
    *  In some rare, non-critical cases, if the deployed program is small and doesn't consume significant resources, it might be acceptable to leave it deployed (but unused). *This is generally not recommended.*

**Important Considerations for Rollbacks:**

*   **Data Migration:**  If you deploy a new version (either upgradeable or a new program ID), plan how to migrate user data to the new version.
*   **Communication:**  Communicate any rollback actions and their impact to your users.
*   **Upgrade Authority:** If using an upgradeable program, securely manage the upgrade authority keypair. Loss of this keypair can prevent future upgrades.

## 7.  Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **Regular Log Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor program logs for errors and performance issues.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
*   **Security Audits:**  Schedule periodic security audits, especially before major updates.
*   **Dependency Updates:**  Keep your program's dependencies (Anchor, Solana CLI, Rust, etc.) up-to-date.
* **Incident Response**: Create an incident response plan.
